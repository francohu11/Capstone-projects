Kobe Bryant is known as the ‘Jazz Killer’. When the Los Angeles Lakers played against the Utah Jazz, Kobe Bryant tended to be unstoppable
and get abnormally high points. But actually there was not much analysis or some proper reasons to explain why that happened, and that seemed
to be just an interesting fact. So we came up with an idea: would it be possible to use maybe the last five or ten game outcomes against
the same team to be a good prediction of their next encounter?

Being able to make such predictions could prove to be extremely helpful. If predictions are close to actual performance, team coaches could 
form up a group focusing on calculating their opponents’ average statistics, so that they can have a better preparation about who should be 
defended harder or who can be somewhat ignored when there is a bigger threat like Kobe Bryant. And the prediction can also be linked with
the win or lose, which means if Kobe Bryant had a great performance, and meanwhile the Lakers won the game, so definitely Kobe Bryant played
an important role and should be taken good care of.
